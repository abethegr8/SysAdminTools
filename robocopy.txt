Example of a robocopy from Original Server to New Server along with Mirror Switches, ZB for restartable mode, XO to exclude older folders
and files don't bother copying if it has an older date, R:1 means number of retries on failed copies, W:10 wait time in seconds between 
retries, TEE is a logging option just logs out to window and a file, COPY:DATSOU copy is a copy flag in which uses all the flags 
D=Data, A=Attributes, T=Timestamps S=Security=NTFS ACLs, O=Owner info, U=aUditing info and finally the Log flag in which we output
